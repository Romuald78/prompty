<title>Using Views for Start/End Screens
Views allow you to easily switch "views" for what you are showing on the window. You can use this to support adding screens such as:
- Start screens
- Instruction screens
- Game over screens
- Pause screens

The View class is a lot like the Window class that you are already used to.

The View class has methods for on_update and on_draw just like Window

We can change the current view to quickly change the code that is managing what is drawn on the window and handling user input.

If you know ahead of time you want to use views, you can build your code around the Instruction Screens and Game Over Screens.

However, typically a programmer wants to add these items to a game that already exists.

This tutorial steps you through how to do just that.
